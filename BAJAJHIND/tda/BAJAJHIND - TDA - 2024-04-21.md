### Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421173326.png)
- Price is going up from Y DZ from very bottom.
- There seems to be something stopping the price at marked blue area from pencil, can take a look at smaller time frame to refine.
- At H9-Y, created a followup SZ and price does have an achievement of sorts. It killed of DZ which was responsible for pullback from fall in 2008 candle
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421175519.png)
- RB1-H HY SZ is already breached and tested. Marked with white.
- Another HY SZ (RB2-H) also marked, this is a followup SZ from some smaller time frame, looks strong hence keeping it marked.
- DBD (RB3-H) also marked. It tested the above zone wick to wick.
- Zooming in to the recent candles: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421180633.png)
- Price is going up form Yearly, and a proper HY DZ.
### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421181204.png)
- Upper HY SZ is more refined and marked with red area. It is still tested once.
- (RB2-H) HY SZ is a reaction from sort of DBD SZ marked with blue area. Keeping this area, just removing the colour.
- (RB3-H) Q SZ marked, DBD pattern
- Zooming in on recent candles:![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240422102153.png)
- Price is up from Q DZ coinciding with Y, HY DZs
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240422103013.png)
- Monthly demand zones are working aggressively, wherever price is entering into the zone, price is going up from wick only.
- When price breached Monthly SZ, took support of M DZ and acted aggressively.
- Price took off from follow-up DZ aggressively
- Zooming out:![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240422103533.png)
- When Price came down from below baseless M SZ (marked with below red line), only a daily DZ was enough to stop it.
- In upper red line, when price breached this M DBD SZ (which was already tested multiple times). Price went down from W SZ. Which isn't looking that strong anymore, it had a lot of base candles.
- Now there is nothing to stop price until 60-66, deep inside Q SZ.
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240422105547.png)
- Again, when price is reacting from higher time frame SZs, smaller TF DZs are enough to revert the price.
- Reacting aggressively from weekly zones.
- Not a single quality W DZ is broken, so can be aggressive in MIT and WIT.
### EMA-20 Markings

### Notes
- 
### **Conclusions**
- Price is going up from Y, HY, Q, M DZ aggressively.
- While going up price is creating DZs on every time frame and no Monthly, Weekly DZs are getting broken, every zone is getting respected.
- Whenever price hits a proper SZ, similar time frame or smaller time frame DZ is enough to stop it.
- Zones are acting wick to wick (can be a little aggressive while taking trades)
- Nothing to stop price until 60 where a monthly and quarterly SZ are present.
- QIT, MIT trades are present.
- Also price is consolidating right now, maybe before giving an up-move.
