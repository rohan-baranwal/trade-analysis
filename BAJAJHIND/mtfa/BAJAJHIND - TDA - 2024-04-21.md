- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421173326.png)
- Price is going up from Y DZ from very bottom.
- There seems to be something stopping the price at marked blue area from pencil, can take a look at smaller time frame to refine.
- At H9-Y, created a followup SZ and price does have an achievement of sorts. It killed of DZ which was responsible for pullback from fall in 2008 candle
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421175519.png)
- RB1-H HY SZ is already breached and tested. Marked with white.
- Another HY SZ (RB2-H) also marked, this is a followup SZ from some smaller time frame, looks strong hence keeping it marked.
- DBD (RB3-H) also marked. It tested the above zone wick to wick.
- Zooming in to the recent candles: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421180633.png)
- Price is going up form Yearly, and a proper HY DZ.
### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240421181204.png)
- Upper HY SZ is more refined and marked with red area. It is still tested once.
- (RB2-H) HY SZ is a reaction from sort of DBD SZ marked with blue area. Keeping this area, just removing the colour.
