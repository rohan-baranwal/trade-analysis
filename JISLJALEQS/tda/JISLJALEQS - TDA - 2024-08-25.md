- Price is going up from Y DZ RB4Y. But there are too many hurdles we will see in LTFs
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825220148.png)

### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825220516.png)
- Another Q SZ (RB8Q) found coinciding with Y SZ RB1Y.
- Found a Q SZ RB3Q enclosing RB3H. So we can ignore it as we have already found a better HTF SZ.
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825221858.png)
- Price reacted from M DZ RB9M which is coinciding with YDZ RB4Y
- We can see that reaction of price from RB9M was not that strong. Maybe it was strong but it entered HY SZ RB3H. And from there price came crashing in next 2 candles. But something held off the price.. Need to look on smaller time frame
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825222705.png)
- RB9W WDZ was responsible for killing off 2 SZs. That zone is good, Price reacting from there as well. Keep an eye on this stock
