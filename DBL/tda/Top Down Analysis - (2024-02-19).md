### Yearly Time Frame

  Marked the zones I need to check on smaller time frames
  - Interesting price action
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240219215154.png)
- Price still had not reacted to HY SZ so real place of pending orders (maybe origin) (or another SZ on smaller time frame) must be there.
### Quarterly Time Frame

- On smaller time frame I can see that HY SZ in above picture is a reaction of Q SZ which was already tested 4-5 times before.
- Now It hardly looks a SZ which could hold the price.
- Ignore the green color of above SZ.
- Also, the origin of price for current up move is narrowed much more in Q time frame. It must be around those lower wicks
