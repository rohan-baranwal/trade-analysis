### Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240219214308.png)
  Marked the zones I need to check on smaller time frames
  - Interesting price action
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240219215154.png)
- Price still had not reacted to HY SZ so real place of pending orders (maybe origin) (or another SZ on smaller time frame) must be there.
### Quarterly Time Frame

- On smaller time frame I can see that HY SZ in above picture is a reaction of Q SZ which was already tested 4-5 times before.
- Now It hardly looks a SZ which could hold the price.
- Ignore the green color of above SZ.
- Also, the origin of price for current up move is narrowed much more in Q time frame. It must be around those lower wicks
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240219221931.png)
- Found nothing in wicks of Q time frame analysis for DZ on M time frame
- Lots of monthly SZs which are reaction of previous SZs and broke multiple M DZs.
- Marked lines h4 and h5 as the hurdles for price action
- SZ near to current price is looking really good
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240219224324.png)
- Price is currently in W SZ. Already reacted to it last week. but looks like it is going to break soon

### Conclusions
- Price is approaching towards M SZ.
- Price might come down in our trade zones if there is any
