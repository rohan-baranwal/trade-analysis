- Y DZ is more refined.
- While going up, price created one more HY DZ with multiple bases
- There was one HY SZ Structure. Which was broken too soon. Marked PL of SZ with Red.

### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240527200041.png)
- Price is going up from Y, HY, Q DZ. All coinciding at one place.
- During COVID. Price reacted from this common zone only. And created a Q DZ while going up.
- HY DZ marked above looks like a lot of garbage. But marked an area with pencil from where price was reacting. Maybe a DZ in smaller time frame.
- Recently created a small DZ at top which also gave reaction.
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240529212629.png)
- M DZs are getting respected. Even very temporary ones.
- A good sign to go long probably
- At ATH now, so no supply zones. Whatever supply zones were there, got broken easily and with power.
- The zone marked above in QTF with pencil shows a monthly DZ was responsible for providing support.
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240529222323.png)
- Price is struggling to give closing above W SZ. Though the SZ is not that strong, still price is struggling. Maybe the buying pressure is getting weaker, need to check on DTF.
- Can see one more long wick on top. Can find a SZ around there.
- Weekly DZs are getting respected as well. No W DZ has been broken yet.
