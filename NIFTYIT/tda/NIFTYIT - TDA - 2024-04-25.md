### Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425075948.png)
- Price is going up from Y DZ from COVID.
- While going up it created a really good Y DZ (marked with RB1-Y - Marking is wrong, which is corrected in QTF). Which killed off Y SZ on 2004 candle. *(It was a baseless supply zone but still considering some achievement than closing. Maybe we can find something on smaller time frame)*
- Also, price has created some Y SZ which is baseless on yearly, we can find something on smaller time frame. Price is reacting from there
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425081011.png)
- While going up price created a HY DZ (marked with RB2-H). This zone doesn't have a good achievement but still considering as timeframe is Half Yearly.
- Nice thing to notice in RB2-H HY DZ is that its base candles have same bottom wicks, maybe there is a DZ in smaller time frame which was enough to handle that big red candle.
- Also need to look for the zone which was responsible for holding COVID selling pressure and what happened to price after that.
- Created a SZ line (H3-H) to check which DZ was responsible to kill that zone off.
### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425100400.png)
- Price is coming down from those Y, HY baseless SZ. A proper structure is found on Q Time frame. *(marked the Q SZ with RB4-Q)*
- Also, while going up price did some action on (RB3-Q) Q SZ. Look at the wicks, price broke the zone then came down and then went up back again. That means something happened on the smaller time frames.
- Corrected the Marking of Y DZ (RB1-Y). Able to see that something is at bottom. Need to check smaller time frames
- Changed the marking of 2004 SZ with H2-Q and H3-Q. Still need to check which DZ was responsible for killing that zone.
### Monthly Time Frame
- Zooming in to the COVID times: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425103224.png)
- The M DZ (RB5-M) is the zone which is at the most bottom of COVID fall. This RBR DZ took price above the range bound area where it was stuck since some time. Hence this area is important.
- When price recovered after entering this zone, It created a DBR pattern which again is good as it gave closing above all the SZs and created a new high (not ATH)
- Zooming in into the recent picture: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425104714.png)
- Between H2-Q and H3-Q SZ. Price breached the zone easily but could not give closing properly.
- If I check weekly time frame  
  ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425104820.png)  
  There isn't anything special to see. Price created some smaller W SZs and DZs and respected each other for few times and then finally price went rocket.
- HY DZ (RB2-H) is looking like a garbage at monthly. need to refine it later.
- Zooming in to more recent picture: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240425120158.png)
- M DZ (RB5-M) looks like a good zone, but it is broken easily. Means either the buying was getting tired, and from the candles on weekly, looks like that only, buying pressure was getting tired.
- While coming down and breaking this M DZ, a W SZ is formed with a proper structure and good achievement.
