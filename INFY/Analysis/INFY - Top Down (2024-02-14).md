- Nothing alarming on Yearly time frame![](_attachments/10164288257a34569c2bb149373742e3.png)

### Half Yearly Time Frame

- I noticed some action in the candles, will need to check on smaller time frames.![](_attachments/48e6222b413b9c5fa42c294521a2e497.png)
- Supply zone is consistent in Y and HY

### Quarterly Time Frame

- The action seems a little clearer, Price was crashing hard in 2023 Jan quarter, but something happened in smaller time frame and price pushed back.![](_attachments/79e85ebba997caf3a9e8b128164def80.png)
- There is no supply zone coming soon, nearest one is consistent on Yearly, HY, Quarterly. The zone is consistent, looks extremely strong.

### Monthly Time Frame

- Demand zones are being respected.![](_attachments/b569b36e77bd0b20c8baf25d8be68e8a.png)
- I need to keep an eye for the zone marked in green as a backup if price ever came crashing down.
- One supply zone broken by a DZ. Looks good![](_attachments/354232512958c81eec2849cb80d56144.png)

### Questions
1. ***Why did this selling pressure break EMA 20 support?***   ![](_attachments/0093f7be09f4da2a6593fa2fad4db2f6.png)
   We should not give that much importance to EMA 20.

2. ***Follow up of above question on smaller time frame. Why did price go up from here?***![](_attachments/329c4f5d10e68779480bc050e49df0a6.png)
