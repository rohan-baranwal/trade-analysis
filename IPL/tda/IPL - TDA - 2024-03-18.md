### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240318214521.png)
- Marking very basic M DZ, Price origin is at just before legout.
- Another DZ, marked in white, was broken by high selling pressure. There was nothing bad in the zone but still it got SL.
- Looks like price will take time to consolidate in the current zone.
- Will wait for confirmation entry
