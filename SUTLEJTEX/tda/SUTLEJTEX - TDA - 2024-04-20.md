### Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420190019.png)
- Price is going up from Y DZ.
- Also came down from Y SZ but followup Y DZ was enough to take the price
- Marked the PLs of all zones
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420193326.png)
- Marked a HY SZ which from where price came down into a HY DZ.
- Marked RB2 as White because price is acting from here and zone is tested fully. Need to look at smaller time frame the exact DZ which withheld the price.
- Also, marked this zone with gap opening theory. You can see the second base 
- Marked DLs of two SZ structures. Want to find out why those wicks were formed. Maybe can find a SZ on smaller time frame.
- Found a DBR DZ, marked with RB3. Price has not come here yet

- A DBD type of SZ marked with RB4, can see clearly that price is struggling to break that zone.
- RB4 HY SZ is a followup zone formed from upper Y+HY SZ. Hence marked with light red color.
- Need to dig deeper into this zone.
- (Quickly took a look, there is a weekly SZ responsible for price coming down from H2-H, will mark it on weekly time frame)
### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420211340.png)
- On Quarterly picture is not getting much clear.
- We can see that RB2 DZ is a zone which killed off multiple Q SZs.
- Apart from it, price is going up from Y, HY, Q DZs.
- Price is trying to go up but looks like there are too many SZs hence long wicks are forming.
- Marked H2-Q to see if there is anything on top.
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420214132.png)
- From the same place, price is going up from a monthly DZ.
- Price is heavily tested in all SZs, and while going down creating other SZs and testing them as well while going down.
- Similar can be said for DZs, While going up, price is making DZs and respecting all DZs.
- The Fresh DZ on monthly is getting clearer ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420214715.png)
- Marked the M DZ coinciding with Q and HY DZ
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240420223653.png)
- When Arun sir created showed us TDA of this, at that time it was in Feb. In March, price entered the zone and is going up from there.
- On monthly it has created a SZ type of structure, which might stop price for some time but is created by a followup zone.
