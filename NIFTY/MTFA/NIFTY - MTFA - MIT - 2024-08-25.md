1. RB13D - Deep inside M DZ, also between WDZ and QDZ. Looks like Highly Probable Zone
2. RB12D - Aggressive. Price is currently inside D SZ. Taking support of MDZ PL for SL will be a good idea
### Score
1. 6 = 3+1+2 (Fresh Zone, 1 Exciting Candle with no gap, 1-3 base candles) (Considering because it is deep inside coinciding zones)
2. 6 = 3+1+2 (Fresh Zone, 1 Exciting Candle with no gap, 1-3 base candles) (This zone is a little, might consider it depending on low selling pressure)
