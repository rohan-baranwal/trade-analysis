### Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417092909.png)
- Price gone up from RBR DZ during COVID.
- Formed another DZ with extremely wide range H3 and H2
- Also created a good Y DZ, marked with green.
- No Supply zone is seen.

- Marked area with Blue is the zone that gave breakout above the long consolidation. Its that zone which can hold marked crash of any intensity
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417100708.png)
- Refined the COVID Y DZ. Marked the lines with green color as well
- There seems to be something at bottom of YDZ marked at top with RB1-Y. Will have to look at smaller time frame.
- While going up price action created a good HY DZ. Marked with RB3-H
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417101350.png)
- In F1-H we can see that there was something stopping the price, so take a look at smaller time frame. **(TODO)**
  Can see the detail on Q TF

### Quarterly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417103041.png)
- Picture is becoming more clear. Zooming in and explaining each area deeply
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417120630.png)
- We can see that COVID Y DZ is broken further into smaller zones. So deleting H3 and H1 lines.
- On QTF we have the zone which killed off COVID selling. On smaller time frame we can look deeply.
- This RB6 zone is special as it took price to ATH and broke COVID zone. Hence marking blue
- On the lower wick of Big red candle, Can check for some zone on smaller time frame
#### 2024-08-25 Update
- All coinciding zones found at a place. (Image below, RB7Q, RB3H, RB1Y are all coinciding. RB7Q looks extremely promising. Marked with Blue)
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825134218.png)
- Created another QDZ @ RB8. RBR pattern
- RB5Q and RB3H are coinciding. Very good zone for future crash
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825144054.png)
- Price is at ATH
- RB7Q and RB5Q ended a long consolidation of price. If you look at Q TF it become more clear that RB7Q ended the consolidation. and RB5Q carried out the movement further.
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825164202.png)
- Found MDZs, RB8M and RB5Q coinciding perfectly. Can fined a smaller zone there
- A much bigger zone with RB9M and RB8Q formed recently. Price also reacted from this zone. This zone is slightly tested. Might have to find a proper execution inside this zone by considering it as a location.
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825202300.png)
- RB9W is a really sweet spot to consider. HY, Q, W DZs are coinciding. Can keep entry a little above just not to miss. This spot can be considered In case of crazy crash
- Also marked RB10W, Zone is inside M DZ and coincides a little with Q DZ as well. If price comes near Q DZ then we can be a little aggressive
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825202859.png)
- If I consider that long base candle, it was a red candle at some point. So if I consider that as a leg-in, then I can modify RB10W a little and make range a little narrow

#### 2024-09-08 Update
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240908175846.png)
- Price created a good D SZ.
- Right now price just entered a W DZ which does not look that strong. Will have to look individual stocks to figure out what will happen next week.
  My hypothesis will be that price might come down till 24350 something in this week to give a consolidation.
