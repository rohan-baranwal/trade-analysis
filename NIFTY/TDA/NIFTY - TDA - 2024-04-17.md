- Marked area with Blue is the zone that gave breakout above the long consolidation. Its that zone which can hold marked crash of any intensity
### Half Yearly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417100708.png)
- Refined the COVID Y DZ. Marked the lines with green color as well
- There seems to be something at bottom of YDZ marked at top with RB1-Y. Will have to look at smaller time frame.
- While going up price action created a good HY DZ. Marked with RB3-H

- In F1-H we can see that there was something stopping the price, so take a look at smaller time frame.
### Quarterly Time Frame

- Picture is becoming more clear. Zooming in and explaining each area deeply
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240417120630.png)
- We can see that COVID Y DZ is broken further into smaller zones. So deleting H3 and H1 lines.
- On QTF we have the zone which killed off COVID selling. On smaller time frame we can look deeply.
- This RB6 zone is special as it took price to ATH and broke COVID zone. Hence marking blue
- On the lower wick of Big red candle, Can check for some zone on smaller time frame
