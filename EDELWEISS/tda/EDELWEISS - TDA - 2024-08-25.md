  Price is currently into the same zone
- No DZ in sight
### Monthly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825225227.png)
- RB4M shows that price coming down from Q SZ RB3Q is held off by a M DZ. So most probably SZ doesn't have any strength left.
- The new DZ forming in current candle, looks promising as it suggests buying pressure and smallest of DZs are getting respected
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825225555.png)
- RB5M MDZ if formed will show a lot of promise if price comes down in a week or two because that zone finished a lot of MSZs which were already tested.
### Weekly Time Frame
- ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240825230104.png)
- RB7W DZ is formed with good potential. It is Deep inside MDZ RB5M if formed.
- RB6W WDZ is aggressive. It would be stupid if price came down from QSZ and we might try to trade it
